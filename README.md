# Passion Project

This repo is just of a passion project where I am helping teach one of my closest friends the basics of programming. We aimed to implement a rudamentary version of Pac-Man in HTML using Javascript. We weren't so much interested in actually getting the game loop working at the time, but instead just how programming works and how to program.
